# Employee_Salary_Prediction_AADE

This project implements an end-to-end Employee Salary Prediction Pipeline that demonstrates how data engineering and machine learning integrate into a reproducible workflow. The system ingests structured CSV data, performs preprocessing and feature engineering, trains a regression model, persists it, and performs real-time salary prediction from new inputs — all executed locally using VS Code.

The pipeline reflects core data engineering stages: data ingestion, transformation (ETL), encoding of categorical features, model training, model storage, and inference. It is designed to be modular, easy to run, and extensible for future enhancements such as UI integration or deployment.
